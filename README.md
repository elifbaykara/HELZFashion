## Issues and Solutions
In this project, we encountered several challenges related to the database. Here are the main issues and how these problems were addressed:
Errors and File Path Issues:
We faced various errors in database operations.
Issues arose with file paths.
Solution:
A detailed investigation was conducted to fix errors and address file path problems.
Database Viewing Problem:
There were difficulties in viewing the created database.
Solution:
Meticulous work was done on the database connection and configuration.
File Conflicts and Conflict Resolution:
Some files conflicted in the project, resulting in conflicts.
Solution:
Conflict resolutions were performed via Git, and file conflicts were resolved.
Usage of Two Separate Databases:
Two separate databases were used in the project: HelzIdentity (for the Identity part) and TeamHelz (Project database).
Solution:
Necessary configurations were made to ensure compatibility between the two databases.
Necessity to Recreate Databases:
Due to issues with the databases, we had to delete and recreate them.
Solution:
The databases were deleted, configurations were reviewed, and the databases were recreated.
Dealing with these issues was a learning process to overcome challenges, gain more knowledge about database usage, and work on configuration improvements.
